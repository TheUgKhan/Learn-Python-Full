This repository contains everything that is needed to learn Python from basics to advanced level.It contains Python Basic and Data Structures at the moment.
Also it is an ongoing repository i.e. Under construction which means that there will be much more in the future like NumPy , Pandas , SkLearn as well as PyTorch.
