    "# Inheritance: \n",
    "Inheritance is an important aspect of the object-oriented paradigm. Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class. In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss inheritance in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a derived class can inherit base class by just mentioning the base in the bracket after the derived class name. Consider the following syntax to inherit a base class into the derived class.\n",
